Factly is a modern CLI tool designed to evaluate the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs) on the MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) benchmark. It provides a robust framework for prompt engineering experiments and factual accuracy assessment.

.. -teaser-end-

.. -overview-begin-

Features
--------

- Evaluate LLM factuality on the MMLU benchmark with detailed results
- Support for various prompt engineering experiments via configurable system instructions
- Generate comparative visualizations of factuality scores across models and prompts
- Structured output for easy analysis and comparison
- Built with modern Python tooling (Python 3.12, uv, click, pydantic)
- Extensible and reproducible evaluation workflows

.. note::

   Currently, only OpenAI models are supported.

Quick Start
-----------

.. code-block:: bash

   # Run factuality evaluation with default settings
   factly evaluate

   # Run evaluation and generate plots
   factly evaluate --plot

   # Get help on all available options
   factly evaluate --help


That's it! The tool uses optimized default parameters and saves all outputs to the ``output`` directory.

For more advanced usage, including saving results and evaluation, see the `Usage Guide <https://factly-eval.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>`_.
